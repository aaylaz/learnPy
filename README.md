## About the Project

This repository will combine short exercises to practice Python. They are compiled from several sources but only display the code I have written to solve the problem. Goal of solving these exercises is to improve Python coding skills as well as creating a useful repository for others to use and document progress.

## Usage

The exercises will be sorted according to what data type or problem they are targeting. The readme of each folder will contain the exercises, the solutions will be in the py files of each folder. <br />

## Roadmap

New exercises will be added continuously.
